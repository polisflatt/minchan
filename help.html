        <p style="display: inline;">
            Minchan is a channel like 4chan and 8chan (though made completely from scratch, though it uses futaba for css). It has no image support, since hence its name: minimal channel; it also has no images to prevent illegal content from being distributed on the site. Minchan is also open source, but we are in a testing phase, so the source code will have to wait.
        
        </p>
        <p>
            Minchan is created in PHP, with no framework. It doesn't even use an SQL Database - It's that minimal! Anyone can host if they have the source code (though as previously said before, it's full of bugs and it isn't commented for people to understand how it works). Minchan offers no option to create your own boards, but it will in the future. Unlike 8chan, it will separate custom boards from the boards originally offered by Minchan, in order to mitigate users being spread out too far (think /tech/ and /g/).

        <p>Currently, there is no official ban system. But if are to find out that someone is doing unfavorable activity, we will manually block their requests, meaning that they cannot post nor visit this website - extra caution! Do not try anything sneaky or you will be banned!</p>

        <p>Like 4chan, you can greentext and quote people by their IDs. You can also use a tripcode in the same way you would on 8chan or 4chan, by writing a # after your name, then followed by your password (Name#Password). Unlike 8chan, the tripcodes are generated on basis of SHA256, which is much more secure than the default DES.</p>
